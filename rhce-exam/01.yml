1. Install and Configure Ansible on the control node as follows:

  * Install the required packages.
  * Create a static inventory file called /home/student/ansible/inventory as follows:
          -- servera.lab.example.com is a member of the dev host group
          -- serverb.lab.example.com is a member of the test host group
          -- serverc.lab.example.com is a member of the prod host group
          -- serverd.lab.example.com is a member of the balancers host group
          -- The prod group is a member of the webservers host group
  * Create a configuration file called ansible.cfg as follows:
          -- The host inventory file /home/student/ansible/inventory is defined
          -- The location of roles used in playbooks is defined as /home/student/ansible/roles
          -- The location of collections used in playbooks is defined as /home/student/ansible/collections

# sudo yum install ansible-navigator ansible tree vim -y (In Exam it will work)

podman login utility.lab.example.com
